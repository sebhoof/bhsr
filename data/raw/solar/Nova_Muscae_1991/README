The MC simulations computed for 3000 parameter sets and for two values of the viscosity parameter

1. Naming Rules


(1)samples0518_3_001.npy


0518_3 represents that this is the third spectrum observed in 05.13
001 represents that the viscosity of this spectrum is alpha=0.01

(2)samples0402.npy

0402 represents that this is the spectrum observed in 04.02
Besides, the viscosity of this spectrum is alpha=0.1

2. Each parameters in the file represents, in turn:
     dis    mass    incl      nh   Gamma    Frac    spin     Mdd
